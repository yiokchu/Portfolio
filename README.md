# Portfolio

I made this website to market my strengths and abilities by providing a creative way of presenting them. This is an online sample/proof of my work and what I have accomplished.

This portfolio showcases my work to potential employers.

The  website was created from scratch using HTML and CSS, and hosted on Netlify.
